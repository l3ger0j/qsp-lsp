# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New
- Every file is now analysed one location at a time, open or closed and whatever its size, so a file shows the same symbols and warnings either way, a syntax error in one location no longer affects the others, and an edit re-parses only its location. The status bar's "Per-location parsing" and "Large file" states are gone with the whole-file parse they described.
- Opening a file that was analysed before, by the project or in an earlier session, reuses that analysis and parses nothing up front: a location is parsed when its highlighting or folding is asked for, the visible lines first (a 12.8 M-character file: diagnostics after 3 s instead of 23 s). A file that stays open between sessions is stored in the cache too.
- An unchanged project reads how locals pass between locations from the analysis cache instead of working it out again, when that took long: on a 15.6 M-character game in 10 files, its aggregates take 0.9 s on start instead of 6.6 s.
- The aggregates an edit rebuilds take a third of the time and memory they did (on a 15.6 M-character game in 10 files: 0.5 s and ~70 MB of garbage instead of 1.5 s and ~260 MB).
- An edit that changes code but not the calls that pass locals (a value, a condition) works out again only the variables whose passing it changes, not all of them: on a 15.6 M-character game in 10 files the aggregates take 1.5 s instead of 5 s.
- An edit that changes nothing other locations can see (game text, comments, new lines) no longer works out again how locals pass between locations through calls: on a 15.6 M-character game in 10 files, an edit is checked in 1.9 s instead of 7 s; the same holds for a file open outside a project.
- In a project, an edit that changes nothing other files can see (game text, comments, new lines) no longer diagnoses every file again, only the edited one; nor does opening or closing a file (on a 15.6 M-character game in 10 files, an edit is checked in 7 s instead of 11 s).
- An analysis read back from the cache takes less memory than a fresh one instead of more (a 12.8 M-character file: 212 MB instead of 293 MB; a fresh analysis of it, 230 MB instead of 243 MB).
- Closing a project file whose text is unchanged on disk keeps the editor's analysis of it instead of analysing it again (seconds for a large file).
- **Analysis cache**: each project file's analysis is kept on disk (VS Code's workspace storage) and read back when the file hasn't changed, and an unchanged project shows the diagnostics it had last time at once, replacing them when the cross-file analysis has run, so a project opens much faster the second time (on a 20 MB game, diagnostics after 5.4 s instead of 36 s). `qsp.cache.enabled`, **QSP: Clear Analysis Cache**.
- **QSP Libraries** view: install, update and remove libraries from `libraries.json` catalogs (`qsp.libraries.sources`), with checksums, requirements, and a check against the game's location names before anything is written ([LIBRARIES.md](LIBRARIES.md)).
- A build (**Run**, **Export**, MCP `qsp_build`) stops when two locations share a name and lists every place: a player would reach only one of them.
- Libraries listed under `libraries` in `txt2gam.json` (sources in `libs/`) are built into `.qsp` files of their own for `inclib`, never into the game's.
- Every diagnostic has a code: the name of its check's `qsp.diagnostics.<code>` setting (`syntax` for syntax errors), shown in the Problems panel and returned by the MCP `qsp_diagnostics`. Outdated built-ins get their own setting, `qsp.diagnostics.deprecatedBuiltins`.
- `!@qsp-ignore` comments silence a check where its finding is intended: on the next line, on their own line after `&`, in the location (`!@qsp-ignore-location`) or in the file (`!@qsp-ignore-file`), for every name or only those after `:`. A misspelled check is reported.
- Quick fixes on a diagnostic: ignore it on this line or in this location (they write the `!@qsp-ignore` comment), or turn its check off in the workspace settings.
- Files in `libs/` show errors only (no warnings about a library's unused locations or variables), and a duplicate location names the library it clashes with.

### Fixes
- A `{…}` block kept in a variable that isn't QSP code (a list of words, `local $fruit = { apple, pear }`) no longer reports its words as variables never assigned, and its syntax errors are hints: QSP checks such a block only when something runs it. A block run where it stands (`dynamic {…}`) is still checked as before.
- A label whose name has brackets or parentheses (`:i[16]i[16]`) was cut at the first bracket and the rest reported as a syntax error; the name is now the whole rest of the line, as QSP takes it. Unary plus (`'a'++rand(0, 20)++'b'`, `x = +5`) is no longer a syntax error.
- `unusedLocations`, `unusedObjects` and `unusedVariables` no longer report a name the game uses as text: a location, object or variable whose name is written to a variable or passed to a call (`$to = 'hall'` … `gt $to`, `gs 'print', 'list'`), or a location a jump target built from text fits (`gs 'eat<<n>>'`). On games from the QSP catalog most of these reports were of such names.
- A location with a syntax error tree-sitter can't recover from (notes written as plain text in the code, an `if` never closed) lost its variables and jumps, kept only its actions and labels, and turned off the "never used" checks of the whole project; the file was also analysed again on every open instead of read from the cache (a 5 M-character game: ready in 10.9 s instead of 1.6 s). Its symbols are now taken from what was parsed.
- The jump graph's statistics in the log could quote game text: a jump target broken by a comment (`gt $curloc - …`) was described by the text where its operator should be. They now name grammar node types and built-in functions only.
- Folding in files past 500 KB matched `act`/`if`/`loop` lines with `end` lines, so a one-line `if x: …` or `act '…': …` shifted the ranges; blocks now fold by the parse, as in smaller files.
- In files past 500 KB and in closed project files, an action or label a syntax error hid from the parser was missing from the Outline and the checks; it is now taken from the text, as in smaller open files.
- `uninitializedVariables` and `mixedVariablePrefixes` gave different results for a file open in the editor and closed (or past 500 KB): only a small open file had the scopes the checks need, so a value that comes through another variable (`б = а` with `а` never assigned) was missed elsewhere. Every file now gets the scope-aware checks (on a 12.8 M-character file, its diagnostics take 3.9 s instead of 3.0 s).
- A write inside a code block held in a `local` of a nested block (`if`, loop) and run by another location through `dynamic` was reported as never read, and hover didn't show it among the caller's values.
- In files past 500 KB, hover showed no possible values for a local of a nested block that takes its value from another variable (`local y = i` in a loop body): scopes were recorded by the parse tree's node ids, which mean nothing in the location's next parse.
- In a project, a large open file (past 500 KB, parsed location by location) showed no syntax errors at all, and closed files could lose theirs after an edit elsewhere.
- A line starting with `--` between locations (an ASCII table, a divider) no longer breaks the highlighting and reports false syntax errors in the rest of that text: only a `#` header starts something there. Reported by Aleks Versus.

## 0.3.0

### New
- **QSP Locations** view in the Explorer: every location of the project, by file or A→Z, with error counts, the start location marked, following the cursor, and rename / duplicate / delete / find references from its context menu.
- **Jump Graph** (**QSP: Show Jump Graph**, `Ctrl+K J`): who jumps to or calls whom, in a tab beside the editor. Around a location, the whole project, or folded by file; hubs hidden, search, hover highlight, click to open a location or the place a jump is written.
  - Dynamic jumps (`gt $next`, `gt 'room_' + n`, `gt $args[0]`, `gt func('pick')`) get **possible** arrows to the locations their variables are known to name, from the nearest write before the jump, the writes before the calls into its location, or every write in the project. Nothing is run; what can't be known still goes to a **?** node.
  - Large games stay usable: a force layout in slices for ~1000 locations, arrows drawn on demand past 5000, and layout that keeps going while the panel is hidden.
- **MCP server** for AI agents: the editor's diagnostics, symbols, references and project information as MCP tools (see [MCP.md](MCP.md)); offered to VS Code agents, and **QSP: Copy MCP Server Config** for other clients.
- **Analysis status** item next to QSP in the status bar: what the server is doing, and degraded modes (**Limited mode**, **Per-location parsing**, **Reduced analysis**).
- **Crash reports**: if the language server stops unexpectedly, a report with numbers and neutral names (never game text) is saved to `.qsp/crash-reports/`, optionally with the anonymized code of the location it was stuck on (`qsp.crashReports.*`).
- Builds: per-file build mode, a configurable main file, the player executable in `txt2gam.json`, and unchanged `.qsp` files are no longer rewritten.
- Syntax errors of project files that are not open are reported.

### Large games
- Games of 1000–1500 locations (25–50 million characters) load without running out of memory: parsing is 8–12× faster, the analysis keeps within bounds on shared local names and deep call graphs, and past 70% of the heap the server drops optional analysis (**Reduced analysis**) instead of crashing.
- `qsp.diagnostics.maxPerFile` (5000) caps the diagnostics of one file.
- `[perf]` lines in the server log give each slow phase's time and memory, without names (`qsp.debug.performanceLog` logs every phase).

### Fixes
- A server crash and parse corruption on some inputs; blocking file I/O and stale trees in project mode; cache invalidation bugs; WASM memory leaks.
- Multiline expressions: operators at the start of a line, line continuations, and a newline before the closing bracket after a multiline `or`.
