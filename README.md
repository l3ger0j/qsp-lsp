# QSP Language Support

Full-featured [QSP (Quest Soft Player)](https://qsp.org) language support for Visual Studio Code, powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server and [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) grammar.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting
- **TextMate grammar** — instant coloring of locations, keywords, strings, variables, operators, labels, and comments
- **Tree-sitter semantic highlighting** — precise, context-aware token coloring (e.g. goto-targeted location names get a distinct style)

### IntelliSense
- **Completions** — built-in statements & functions, keywords, location names, variables, and user functions
- **Hover** — documentation tooltips for built-in functions/statements, location definitions, variable values, and dynamic call locals
- **Signature help** — parameter hints for built-in functions

### Navigation
- **Go to Definition** — jump to location definitions, variable assignments, labels, and actions
- **Find All References** — find all uses of a location, variable, label, action, or object
- **Document Symbols** — outline view with locations, labels, acts, and actions (Ctrl+Shift+O)
- **Document Highlights** — highlight all occurrences of a variable or label under the cursor
- **Go to Location** — quick-pick to jump to any location across the file or project (Ctrl+Shift+L)

### Editing
- **New Location** — insert a new `# name … ---` block
- **Insert Separator** — `---` separator (Ctrl+Shift+-)
- **Sort Locations** — sort A→Z or Z→A
- **Duplicate Location** — quick-pick to copy a location
- **Delete Location** — remove a location with confirmation
- **Rename Location** — rename a location and update all references
- **Move Location Up/Down** — reorder locations in the file (Alt+Up / Alt+Down)
- **Toggle Comment** — toggle `!` comments (Ctrl+/)
- **Format Location** — format the current location (Ctrl+Shift+F)
- **Snippets** — `loc`, `if`, `ife`, `act`, `loop`, `gs`, `gt`, `pl`, and more

### Build & Run
- **Export QSP Game** (toolbar button) — combine all source files and encode them to a binary `.qsp` game file using [txt2gam](https://github.com/QSPFoundation/txt2gam). In project mode the output path is read from `txt2gam.json`; in single-file mode a save dialog is shown. Supports game passwords.
- **Run QSP Game** (toolbar button / `F5`) — export the game to a `.qsp` file and immediately launch it with the configured player executable.
- **Import QSP Game** — decode a binary `.qsp` file back to a `.qsps` text source. Supports game passwords.
- **Combine Project Files** — merge all source files into a single `.qsps` file without binary encoding; useful for inspection or diff.
- **`txt2gam.json`** — optional per-workspace build config committed alongside source files:
  ```json
  {
    "outputFile": "mygame.qsp",
    "files": [
      "intro.qsps",
      "chapters/*.qsps",
      "ending.qsps"
    ]
  }
  ```
  `outputFile` is relative to the workspace root (default: `<folder name>.qsp`). `files` controls the order in which source files are combined (each entry is a glob). If `files` is missing, **Run** and **Export** add it: they list the workspace's `.qsps`/`.qsrc` files with the main file first (see below), so the build order is always written down.
- **Main file** — the file the game starts from: in a combined build its first location is the start location, in a `perFile` build its `.qsp` is the one **Run QSP Game** opens. It is chosen in this order:
  1. `"mainFile"` in `txt2gam.json`, a regular expression searched case-insensitively in each source's workspace-relative path, e.g. `"^main\\.qsps$"`. The first match in build order wins.
  2. The `qsp.game.mainFile` setting, same format.
  3. Otherwise the first file in `files` order. When the setup wizard creates `txt2gam.json`, it asks for the main file with a list; if the list is dismissed, or `qsp.game.mainFileStrategy` is `root`, the first file from the workspace root is used instead. Either way the chosen file is saved as `mainFile`, so `txt2gam.json` always shows which file is the main one.

  A configured pattern that is invalid or matches no source file stops the build with an error.
- **Player** — **Run QSP Game** launches `"playerExecutable"` from `txt2gam.json` if it is set, otherwise the `qsp.game.playerExecutable` setting; with neither, it asks for the player once and saves it to the setting. In `txt2gam.json` a path with a `/` or `\` is relative to the workspace root (so a player kept in the repository works in any checkout), a bare name such as `qspgui` is looked up on `PATH`, and an absolute path is used as is. Since `txt2gam.json` is usually shared, it can hold one path per OS; an OS without an entry falls back to the setting:
  ```json
  "playerExecutable": {
    "win32": "tools/qspgui/qspgui.exe",
    "linux": "/usr/bin/qspgui",
    "darwin": "/Applications/QSP.app/Contents/MacOS/qspgui"
  }
  ```
- **Separate module builds** — set `"buildMode": "perFile"` in `txt2gam.json` (or the `qsp.game.buildMode` setting) to build each source file into its own `.qsp` next to it instead of one combined game: `main.qsps` → `main.qsp`, `data.qsps` → `data.qsp`. `outputFile` is not used in this mode. **Run QSP Game** starts the main file's `.qsp` (see above), and the game loads the other modules itself with `INCLIB 'data.qsp'`. When it creates `txt2gam.json` in this mode, the setup wizard writes `buildMode` instead of `outputFile`. A `.qsp` whose content hasn't changed is not rewritten. The `txt2gam.json` value overrides the setting. Two sources that would produce the same `.qsp` (e.g. `a.qsps` and `a.qsrc` in one folder) are reported as an error, and nothing is written if any file fails to build.

### Multi-File Operations
- **List All Locations** — browse all locations across the file or project
- **List All Objects** — browse all objects (addobj) with their definition location
- **List All Variables** — browse all variables with usage summaries
- **Move Locations to File** — select locations and move them to another QSP file
- **Split Locations into Files** — select locations and create one `.qsps` file per location

### Analysis Status
- The `{}` item next to **QSP** in the status bar shows what the language server is doing: a spinner while it starts, loads the project (with a file count) or analyzes a large file, then **Ready** with the project size.
- It also warns about degraded modes: **Limited mode** when the tree-sitter parser failed to load (regex-only analysis), and **Per-location parsing** when a file's whole-file parse took too long. Click it (or run **QSP: Show Language Server Log**) for the server log.

### MCP Server (AI agents)
The extension ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets AI agents work with a QSP project through the same analysis the editor uses, instead of plain text search.

See [MCP.md](MCP.md) for what each tool does and how to connect agents.

**Tools** (names are case-insensitive, lines are 1-based):
- **Reading the project:**
  - `qsp_list_locations`, `qsp_get_location`: list locations or get one's source.
  - `qsp_find_references`: where a location, variable or object is defined and used.
  - `qsp_diagnostics`: errors and warnings of the project or one file.
  - `qsp_check_code`: diagnostics of code that isn't saved yet.
  - `qsp_lookup_builtin`: documentation of a builtin. The whole reference is also the `qsp://builtins` resource.
  - `qsp_list_variables`, `qsp_list_objects`: every variable or object in the project.
- **`qsp_build`**: builds the `.qsp` like **Export QSP Game**, following `txt2gam.json`. It is never interactive: the password comes from the `qsp.game.password` setting.
- **`qsp_rename`, `qsp_format_location`**: rename a location, variable or object across the project, or format one location. Both only show the changes unless called with `apply: true`.

**In VS Code** (1.101+), the server is offered to agents such as Copilot agent mode automatically; turn it off with `qsp.mcp.enabled`.

**Other agents** (Cline, Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, …): run **QSP: Copy MCP Server Config** and paste the JSON into the agent's MCP configuration. The config starts the server with VS Code's own runtime, so no separate Node.js is needed; it points at the installed VS Code and extension versions, so copy it again after updating either. To start the server with your own Node.js instead, use Node.js 18 or newer, e.g. for Claude Code:
```
claude mcp add qsp -- node <extension folder>/out/mcp/server.js --workspace .
```
If the agent reports "Connection closed", its log shows the server's stderr: an older Node.js is reported there by name and version.

The server reads the files on disk: save files open in the editor before asking an agent to rename or format, and a file changed on disk after the analysis is not overwritten.

### Project Mode
- When `qsp.project.enabled` is true, all `.qsps`/`.qsrc` files in the workspace are treated as one combined game
- Cross-file diagnostics: duplicate locations, unresolved references, variable dataflow
- Cross-file completions, go-to-definition, and navigation

### Diagnostics
- **Syntax errors** from tree-sitter parsing
- **Duplicate locations** — within a file or across the project
- **Duplicate labels & actions** — scope-aware, only flags same-scope duplicates
- **Unclosed locations** — missing `---` closer
- **Uninitialized variables** — used but never assigned, chain-aware
- **Unresolved references** — location, label, action, and object refs
- **Unused definitions** — locations, labels, variables, and objects
- **Invalid function prefix** — built-in called with incompatible `$`/`#`/`%`
- **Invalid argument count** — built-in called with too few/many args
- **Mixed variable prefixes** — variable accessed with inconsistent `$`/`#`/`%`
- **Type mismatch** — assigning a string value to a `%` variable, etc.
- **Mixed location call types** — location called inconsistently (mix of func/gosub/goto/desc)
- **Inconsistent local propagation** — variable behaves as local or global depending on caller
- **Untracked dynamic calls** — `dynamic`/`dyneval` whose first argument can't be pinned to a single code block (complex expression, multiple global assignments, or multiple local code-block bindings across distinct scopes)
- **Embedded `exec:` analysis** — full symbol extraction and lint coverage for QSP code embedded in HTML `<a href="exec:…">` links inside displayed strings
- **Embedded `<<…>>` analysis** — interpolation bodies are parsed inline by the grammar; bodies corrupted by host doubled-quote escapes (e.g. `'<<f(''a'')>>'`) are decoded and re-parsed in a post-pass so diagnostics still fire
- **Missing `result` in function call** — function-style call (`@loc`, `func`, or `dyneval` block) that never assigns `result`
- **Extra args to target without `args`** — call passes extra positional arguments but the target location or inline code block never reads the `args` variable; the extras are silently discarded
- **Shadows call-frame built-in** — `local args` / `local result` is unnecessary: both are already per-call-frame variables, so the `local` keyword has no effect at a location's top level and merely hides the outer value inside a nested scope
- **Shadows propagated local** — `local x` in a callee re-declares a name that one or more callers already propagate as a local

### Status Bar
- Shows the current location name at cursor position
- Click to open the Go to Location quick-pick

## QSP Language Basics

QSP files are organized into **locations** — named blocks delimited by `#` and `---`:

```qsp
# start
pl 'Hello, world!'
act 'Go north':
  goto 'room1'
end
---

# room1
$name = 'Player'
pl 'Welcome, <<$name>>'
---
```

Key concepts:
- **`$`** prefix → string variable (`$name`)
- **`#`** prefix → numeric variable (`#count`)
- **`%`** prefix → tuple variable (`%arr`)
- **`!`** — line comment
- **`&`** — statement separator (multiple statements on one line)
- **`<<expr>>`** — string interpolation

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build everything (grammar WASM + server + client)
npm run build

# Watch mode
npm run watch

# Run tests
npm test

# UI tests: run inside a downloaded VS Code (needs a display; use xvfb-run on a headless Linux)
npm run test:ui
```

Debug configurations are in `.vscode/launch.json` (open this repository in VS Code, then **Run and Debug**):
- **Run Extension** (**F5**) — builds the bundles and opens an Extension Development Host on `examples/`.
- **Run Extension (Web)** — the same with the browser bundle, as on vscode.dev.
- **Attach to Language Server** — attaches to the server on port 6009; **Extension + Language Server** starts both.
- **UI Tests** — runs `test/ui` under the debugger.
