/**
 * Cross-location / cross-file symbol aggregation — the **call-graph &
 * propagation** subsystem.
 *
 * Pure data structures and functions that collect global variable usage,
 * action/object definitions, location references, and transitive local
 * variable propagation across the call graph (gs / gosub / func / @ /
 * @@).  No closure captures, no mutable server state.
 *
 * ── Layering ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two outputs of `SymbolAggregates` form the public bridge to the
 * **variable-resolution** subsystem in `parser/variableBindings.ts`:
 *
 *   • `externalLocalBindings` — callee writes that flow back onto a
 *     caller-local under gs-call semantics.
 *   • `propagationCallers`    — reverse call-graph index, used by the
 *     resolver's self-shadow path (`local x = x`).
 *
 * These two fields are exactly the structural surface declared by
 * `VarResolverCallGraph` in the parser layer.  `SymbolAggregates`
 * satisfies that interface with no explicit `implements`, keeping the
 * dependency edge one-directional (server → parser, never the reverse).
 *
 * Every other field on `SymbolAggregates` is either internal to this
 * module's post-passes or consumed exclusively by `server/diagnostics.ts`
 * — the resolver does not see them.

  // `$dispatch` against the global namespace and finds `init`'s write.
  //
  // We build a project-wide index of every non-local code-block
  // binding once and then look up each unresolved call's varBase to
  // collect candidates.  The result feeds the cross-location variants
  // of the `missingResultInDyneval` and `extraArgsToTargetWithoutArgs`
