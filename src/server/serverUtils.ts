 * directly by hover/document-highlight in lspFeatures.ts) can't be keyed
 * by plain `loc.nameLower`: a file with a duplicate location name — an
 * error the user will see reported, but one they may be mid-typing when
 * this runs — would collapse onto the same cache slot.
 * `currentIndex.length !== prevCache.size` would then hold forever, so

 * (every keystroke pays for a full per-location re-analysis instead of
 * an O(1)-location incremental one); the full-analysis path silently
 * overwrites one duplicate's cache entry with the other's, leaking the
 * discarded entry's retained tree-sitter tree if it had one; and
 * semantic tokens / hover / document-highlight for every duplicate past
 * the first silently get nothing (a lookup by plain name only ever
 * finds whichever one happens to be stored under it).
 *
 * The occurrence counter gives each duplicate a distinct, and — as long
 * as their relative order doesn't change — *stable* key, so both the
 * `.size` comparison and normal cache reuse work exactly as they did for
 * non-duplicate names. Lives here (rather than in common.ts, which
 * imports lspFeatures.ts) so both common.ts and lspFeatures.ts can use
